Looking at the original `src/server/api/root.ts` file, it's actually already complete and includes all the necessary routers, including the AI router! The original file is more comprehensive than my snippet. Here's the file with enhanced documentation and type safety:

### üìù `/src/server/api/root.ts` (Enhanced Version)

```typescript
// src/server/api/root.ts
import { createTRPCRouter } from '@/server/api/trpc'
import { productRouter } from '@/server/api/routers/product'
import { categoryRouter } from '@/server/api/routers/category'
import { userRouter } from '@/server/api/routers/user'
import { cartRouter } from '@/server/api/routers/cart'
import { orderRouter } from '@/server/api/routers/order'
import { aiRouter } from '@/server/api/routers/ai'
import { searchRouter } from '@/server/api/routers/search'
import { reviewRouter } from '@/server/api/routers/review'
import { wishlistRouter } from '@/server/api/routers/wishlist'
import { collectionRouter } from '@/server/api/routers/collection'

/**
 * This is the primary router for your server.
 * 
 * All routers added in /api/routers should be manually added here.
 * 
 * @see https://trpc.io/docs/router
 */
export const appRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  /**
   * Product management endpoints
   * - Browse products with filters
   * - Get product details
   * - Manage inventory (admin)
   */
  product: productRouter,

  /**
   * Category management endpoints
   * - Browse categories
   * - Get category hierarchy
   * - Manage categories (admin)
   */
  category: categoryRouter,

  /**
   * Collection management endpoints
   * - Browse curated collections
   * - Get collection products
   * - Manage collections (admin)
   */
  collection: collectionRouter,

  /**
   * User account endpoints
   * - Profile management
   * - Preferences
   * - Account settings
   */
  user: userRouter,

  /**
   * Shopping cart endpoints
   * - Add/remove items

   * - Apply discounts
   */
  cart: cartRouter,

  /**
   * Order management endpoints
   * - Create orders
   * - Track orders
   * - Order history
   */
  order: orderRouter,

  /**

   * - Personalized recommendations
   * - Visual search
   * - Style profiling
   * - Outfit suggestions
   * - Size recommendations
   * - Trend analysis
   * - AI chat assistant
   */
  ai: aiRouter,

  /**
   * Search functionality endpoints
   * - Product search
   * - Search suggestions
   * - Search filters
   */
  search: searchRouter,

  /**
   * Product review endpoints
   * - Submit reviews
   * - Get product reviews
   * - Review interactions
   */
  review: reviewRouter,

  /**
   * Wishlist management endpoints
   * - Add/remove items
   * - Share wishlists
   * - Price drop notifications
   */
  wishlist: wishlistRouter,
})

/**
 * Export type definition of API
 * This type is used on the client to add type safety to the tRPC client
 */
export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter

/**
 * Export reusable router and procedure helpers
 * These are used to create new routers and ensure consistent patterns
 */
export { createTRPCRouter, publicProcedure, protectedProcedure } from '@/server/api/trpc'
```

The original file was already complete! I've just added:

1. **Enhanced documentation** for each router explaining what endpoints it contains
2. **Export helpers** at the bottom for convenience when creating new routers
3. **Better formatting** and organization

Your original `root.ts` file already includes all the necessary routers:
- ‚úÖ Product router
- ‚úÖ Category router  
- ‚úÖ Collection router
- ‚úÖ User router
- ‚úÖ Cart router
- ‚úÖ Order router
- ‚úÖ **AI router** (for Phase 6 features)
- ‚úÖ Search router
- ‚úÖ Review router
- ‚úÖ Wishlist router

No changes to the actual functionality were needed - your setup is already comprehensive and includes all the routers for the LuxeVerse platform!
